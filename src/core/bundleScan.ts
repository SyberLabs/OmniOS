// ============================================
// PROJECT OMNI: CLIENT BUNDLE SECRET SCAN
//
// The security property this whole codebase is arranged around is that a
// provider key is read from process.env on the SERVER and never reaches the
// browser. That property was asserted by hand — a grep over `.next/static`
// after a build — which means it held only on the days someone remembered.
//
// This is the same check, mechanised. CI builds with a unique CANARY value
// for every secret env var and then looks for those canaries in the client
// bundle. A canary in `.next/static` means a real key would have been there
// too: someone renamed a var to NEXT_PUBLIC_*, or inlined a secret into a
// client component, or imported a server module from one.
//
// Scanning for canaries rather than for variable NAMES matters: a name proves
// nothing (the string "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" appears harmlessly in server code),
// and CI has no real keys to scan for.
//
// Scope is `.next/static` only, deliberately. Per FINDINGS.md, Turbopack's
// local compile cache under `.next/cache` can inline env values; that cache is
// inside the security boundary and is gitignored. `.next/static` is what a
// browser is actually served.
