// ============================================
// PROJECT OMNI: SECRET ENV VARS
//
// The one list of environment variables whose VALUES must never leave the
// server. Deliberately dependency-free — no `server-only`, no imports — so
// that both the server modules and the build-time bundle scanner can read
// the same list rather than each keeping their own copy that drifts.
//
// Two consumers, one truth:
//   - inference.ledger.ts scrubs these out of anything it stores, because
//     rows are served back to the browser by /api/inference-runs.
//   - scripts/scan-client-bundle.ts builds with canary values for each of
//     these and fails CI if any of them reaches .next/static.
//
// A new keyed provider belongs here the same day its env var is added.
// ============================================
