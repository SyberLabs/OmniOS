# The Citadel: Vision Document

> *An integrated cognitive environment where intelligence flows visibly between data, AI, and human insight.*

---

## The Core Idea

**The Citadel** is not another dashboard. It is a *cognitive workspace*: a spatial environment where you think alongside AI, not just use it.

Traditional tools separate concerns:
- Data lives in one place
- AI lives in another
- Your thoughts live in your head

The Citadel unifies them. Data blocks, AI personas, and your own notes exist on the same canvas, connected by visible wires that show exactly how information flows.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Spatial Intelligence
Intelligence should be **visible and spatial**. When you wire a prediction market to an Analyst persona, you see the connection. When data updates, pulses flow along the wire. Context is not abstract: it is architecture.

### 2. Blocks as Portals
Each block is a portal to a different modality:
- **Data blocks** are windows into the world (markets, news, weather, flights)
- **Persona blocks** are AI minds with specific perspectives
- **Workspace blocks** are your own thinking tools (notes, code, media)

Drag a block onto the canvas. Wire it to a persona. Ask questions. The AI knows exactly what data it's looking at.

### 3. Multiple Minds, Multiple Perspectives
Instead of one AI assistant, The Citadel supports **multiple concurrent personas**:

| Persona | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| 🎯 Analyst | Data-driven pattern recognition |
| ⚔️ Strategist | Long-term planning and tactics |
| 🔬 Researcher | Deep knowledge synthesis |
| 🎨 Creative | Ideation and lateral thinking |
| 🛡️ Guardian | Risk assessment and protection |

Each persona has its own memory, its own context, its own conversation. Wire different data sources to different personas. Let them see different things.

### 4. Shells as Configurations
A **Shell** is a saved arrangement of blocks, wires, and personas. Switch shells to shift your entire cognitive environment:
- *Morning Briefing*: News + Analyst + Calendar
- *Market Watch*: Polymarket + Crypto + Strategist
- *Research Mode*: Papers + Notes + Researcher

The Citadel remembers how you like to think.

## The Information Flow

```
┌─────────────┐       ┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Polymarket  │──────▶│                         │
└─────────────┘       │   🎯 ANALYST PERSONA    │
┌─────────────┐       │                         │
│ NewsAPI     │──────▶│   "Based on market odds │
└─────────────┘       │    and recent news..."  │
                      └─────────────────────────┘
                                 │
                                 ▼
                      ┌─────────────────────────┐
                      │   💎 MEMORY CRYSTAL     │
                      │   (saved insight)       │
                      └─────────────────────────┘
                                 │
                                 ▼
                      ┌─────────────────────────┐
                      │   ⚔️ STRATEGIST PERSONA │
                      │   (receives crystal)    │
                      └─────────────────────────┘
```

Insights can be **crystallized**: saved as new blocks that can themselves be wired to other personas. Over time, a knowledge graph emerges.

## What We're Building Against

Most "AI + data" tools are:
- **Chat-first**: You talk to an AI that has no visible context
- **Tab-scattered**: Data lives in 12 browser tabs, AI in another
- **Stateless**: Every session starts from zero
- **Monolithic**: One AI with one personality for everything

The Citadel rejects all of this. It is:
- **Canvas-first**: Spatial arrangement is the interface
- **Integrated**: Data, AI, and thought in one place
- **Stateful**: Memories persist, shells are saved
- **Plural**: Multiple AI perspectives, each with purpose

## The Experience We Want

You open The Citadel in the morning.

Your *Morning Briefing* shell loads: Polymarket on the left, NewsAPI in the center, your Analyst persona on the right. The wires are already connected. You click "Think". The Analyst pulses, reads the connected data, and offers observations.

You notice something interesting. You ask a follow-up question. The Analyst responds, citing which data sources informed its answer.

You crystallize the insight: it becomes a new block. You wire it to your Strategist persona, along with your notes from yesterday. You ask: "Given this context, what should I do this week?"

The Strategist thinks. Wires pulse. An answer emerges.

This is not "using AI." This is *thinking with AI*.

## The Name

**The Citadel**: a fortress for thought.

Not a bunker. Not a prison. A *citadel* is a stronghold at the heart of a city, a place of command and clarity. It is where you go when you need to think clearly, see widely, and decide wisely.

**Project Omni**: the underlying system. "Omni" because it sees all (your data), remembers all (your memories), and connects all (your personas and blocks).

*"The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled."*
*: Plutarch*

The Citadel provides the fuel. You bring the spark.
